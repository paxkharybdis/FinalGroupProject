# Final Group Project - Object Oriented Programming In C# Certification
Our project was to build a proof-of-concept console application which would simulate an online order of gadgets for retail and wholesale customers.  Gadgets come in three sizes, and each gadget had a set number of widgets, buttons, switches, lights and power sources.  Retail customers would get a static selection, but wholesale customers can choose to add items and customize their purchase.

We built this application using the retail product as the default gadget, and wholesale products building from retail.  Using a Decorator design pattern, we added the customizations.  A Facade design pattern furnished the simple interface, which also included an inventory.  We added serial numbers, UPC codes and tracking numbers with a Singleton design pattern.

### Methodologies
We focused on applying the Software Development Lifecycle, using an Agile methodology.  To manage the Agile environment, we used [taiga.io], and built our sprints using the Software Development Lifecycle as a structure.  

### Documentation
We documented our Use Case Scenario and our structural UMLs using [StarUML].  This was done in the planning stage, before we started coding.  We felt it was important for the integrity of the project, and to insure we were as efficient with the process as we could be.  For our presentation, we relied on [Google Slides].

### IDE
We used [Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition] for our IDE, with the [Code Maid] extension to make sure our code was consistent and maintainable. 

A special shout-out to [Dillinger Online Markdown Editor], because this is new to me and it is so much easier.  *high five*
